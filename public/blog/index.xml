Do you find yourself managing the household, the emotions, and the logistics of your marriage with a sense of weary responsibility that feels older than your years? If so, you might be experiencing the echoes of a childhood role known as &lt;strong&gt;parentification&lt;/strong&gt;, and its impact on your marriage could be more profound than you realize.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;forget-the-grand-gestures-the-gentle-art-of-crafting-a-new-years-resolution-that-actually-sticks&#34;&gt;Forget the Grand Gestures: The Gentle Art of Crafting a New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution That Actually Sticks&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest. How many of us have spent December 31st in a flurry of champagne-fueled optimism, scribbling down a list of life-altering goals, only to find that list—slightly crumpled and filled with guilt—by mid-February? I’ve got a drawer full of them. “Run a marathon.” “Learn fluent Italian.” “Become a morning person who also meditates and bakes their own sourdough.” By January 15th, I’d be exhausted, disappointed, and reaching for the takeout menu, convinced I’d already failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-price-of-love&#34;&gt;The Price of Love&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going to kick off a series that may hit home for a lot of folks. Its about the damage that too much love can cause your child in the long run. Like any story that I am hit with, this woke me up at 4:30 in the morning after a night of meditating about my in-laws, and the damage that being an over-protective parent can do. Like many, I am doing all I can to keep a pair of adult men who were never taught how to care for themselves from showing up at my door in their early 40&amp;rsquo;s, looking for a place to live. But my frustration doesnt compare the the amount of suffering that my wife is enduring. Like any supportive spouse, I know that in order to help, I need to understand, so allow me to share what I have learned in this series in hopes it can help you, as well. . . But first, a story. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-everyone&#34;&gt;Hello, everyone!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quick and honest note from me today. I’m working on growing this blog&amp;rsquo;s reach, and am thrilled with things I plan to add and to do in order to help and entertain. The most powerful way you can help is, of course by sharing. If you read a post that resonates with you or think it could help a friend or loved one, please pass it along.

      <title>New Nintendo Gaming Project Coming Soon</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-love-affair-with-nintendo-is-becoming-a-new-project&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Love Affair with Nintendo is Becoming a New Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I have been a huge fan of Nintendo since I was about nine or ten years old. It all started on a Christmas morning back in 1988. I had just come home from the ER the day before after my first serious brush with death, and that morning, I unwrapped my first Nintendo Entertainment System. Call it what you will; Addiction or brain Damage, but from that moment on, there was simply no turning back. That gray box wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a toy; it was a portal to something that, like many others, helped shaped some of my childhood and the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-alchemist--the-simple-power-of-a-great-book&#34;&gt;The Alchemist &amp;amp; The Simple Power of a Great Book&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of books in the world. Good books, bad books, and those we simply forget. But every now and then, if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, you find a book so profound it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just change your life—it reveals the answers to questions you&amp;rsquo;ve been carrying within you all along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paulo Coelho&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; is that kind of book. It&amp;rsquo;s a short read, barely 180 pages, but I urge you to treat it like all precious things: take your time. Savor it. Ingest its messages slowly and deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s more than enough financial and logistical evidence against it, which means the entire story is a cover. But a cover for &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;? If they could keep a project of this magnitude, with these players, completely hushed up, you can bet they would deny everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;geek-bar-vs-geek-boost-more-than-just-a-knockoff&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geek Bar vs. Geek Boost: More Than Just a Knockoff?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I vape. It’s one of my last remaining vices. Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear, it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt;, but I figure it’s a step up from smoking or, you know, inhaling tremendous amounts of narcotics. I’m writing this because I had a realization about what might be happening behind the scenes in the vape world, and I wanted to share the differences between two brands you might encounter: &lt;strong&gt;Geek Bar&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Geek Boost&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Human Upgrade. Why Our Survival Depends on Redefining Humanity</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;redefining-our-own-definition&#34;&gt;Redefining Our Own Definition&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in a prior post that humanity is a double-edged sword. We have the profound ability to create, matched only by our capacity to destroy. Our darkness can be as void and deep as our brightest, shining light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are masters of ingenuity, yet despite this, we seem unable to learn from our past mistakes. In other words, history keeps repeating itself. The single common denominator throughout the entire history of humankind is us: humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Legacy of Greed, The Future We&#39;re Choosing Not to Build </title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;humanity-a-double-edged-sword&#34;&gt;Humanity: A Double-Edged Sword&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humanity is a double-edged sword. Our ingenuity goes hand-in-hand with our stupidity; of that, I am sure we can all agree. But why? Why do we choose &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to fix what is? Why do those in power consistently fail to make the choices that would better society, and instead only better themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plainly put, we have the resources to solve nearly every problem on earth, yet we &lt;strong&gt;choose&lt;/strong&gt; not to. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s merely my own personal lack of understanding, but if I were in a position of insurmountable wealth, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do everything I could to keep society down. I would focus on ensuring the survival of our species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a story that was always close to her heart from her college studies, but I never personally gave it much thought. That is, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog isn’t a review of &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it’s about a profound truth that struck me while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My particular brand of pedantry is laser-focused on one thing: &lt;strong&gt;the writing.&lt;/strong&gt; The prose. The script. The sacred text that some director probably used to line a birdcage before filming began.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although very comfortable, I still consider myself a laymen (lacking in-depth knowledge of programming languages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted to share some commands that I picked up along the way that have made my every day life easier. I made a conscience effort&amp;ndash;in the early days of full-time Linux&amp;ndash; to stay away from the GUI, and unlock the power of the terminal / command line. This, by far, was the best choice I have made, as I cannot tell you the amount of control that I have (not to mention the time I have saved) when working on my many projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was nothing back then that could condition your patience like the installation of an operating system&amp;hellip;1.44 megabytes of data (and countesses floppy disks) at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward through the decades. We’ve survived the psychedelic paisley of Windows 95, the existential dread of the Clippy paperclip, the bold experiment that was Windows ME (we don’t talk about ME), and the soothing blue tones of Windows XP. We’ve witnessed the rise of the internet, the fall of the dial-up tone, and the mysterious migration of all our data to a celestial entity we call “the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A little over a year ago, I decided to take web development seriously. Little did I know, that decision would lead me on a path from frustration to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;first-steps-a-wordpress-nightmare&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Steps: A WordPress Nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget my first frustrating encounter with WordPress. I was nearly brought to tears trying to figure out why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just &lt;em&gt;drag and drop&lt;/em&gt; elements as I pleased! Despite that rocky start, I persevered. I worked hard, learned the ropes, and eventually built my first patchwork-style website. WordPress, as a CMS, is truly amazing for what it enables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For those of you unfamiliar with this condition, it essentially means that the sockets in between the bones in my spine have worn down and the vertebrae are grinding against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like normal wear and tear on an aged automobile, this is a condition that many people suffer from. The only issue that I had with this, was that it is usually diagnosed in the elderly, ages 80+. Put simply, I have put far too many miles on this engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was wrong. It is affecting me and has been for some time. Now, myself, along with 44 million other Americans who rely on SNAP assistance to feed our families, finds that November will be a very difficult month for many of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;trading-up-to-linux-why-i-dumped-windows&#34;&gt;Trading up to Linux. Why I dumped Windows.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, I know what I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means I am aware that there is a whole lot going on behind the scenes that I am not privy to and, furthermore, can do little to change. Crypticism aside, what it all boils down to, at least for me, is &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;major-trust-issues&#34;&gt;Major Trust Issues&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have trust issues, and rightfully so. I have hacked and been hacked. I have gained and I have lost. My journey toward taking security seriously, on a personal level, went far beyond the methods I employed and trained in while working as a network engineer for the better half of my career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-years-lost-and-20-years-taken&#34;&gt;10 Years Lost and 20 Years Taken.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel it’s best to kick off this new site with a story. I promise, it won’t take long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A ghost. A recluse. Once the center of events, I had withdrawn from everything that I knew and loved. It was not by choice. Not at first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, I was poisoned with pride. Magnetic. Charismatic. Having come from the streets, I pulled myself out of places where hope held no domain to having everything that I had wanted. I was at the peak of my career as a Network Engineer. Flashy new German cars. All the toys I could possibly flaunt, and everything I needed to stay on top of all of my hobbies. I was the center of envy, and that nourished me around every turn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Our New Internet Old Extraterrestrial Technology?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;could-it-be-true&#34;&gt;Could it be True?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theories, the not-so-serious or non-political kind, serve as a mental break from work, much like recess time did in grade school. Pondering their merit, whether factual or not, is beside the point. As humans, we&amp;rsquo;re drawn to mysteries and &lt;em&gt;what-ifs&lt;/em&gt; in life. We enjoy daydreaming about an Undiscovered Country that only requires our time for refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;nothing-to-see-here-move-along&#34;&gt;Nothing To See Here. Move Along&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I mention &lt;em&gt;Roswell, NM&lt;/em&gt;, our thoughts instantly transform into a UFO crash—an event (&lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;non-event&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;) that took place in 1947. Alongside this image, we envision countless roadside diners in New Mexico displaying flying saucer logos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You know, the one where you ask ChatGPT to write your emails, let Midjourney create your Instagram aesthetic, and rely on Google Assistant to remind you to drink water (ironic, isn’t it?). Isn’t it just &lt;em&gt;so convenient&lt;/em&gt; to have machines do all the thinking for us? Sure, it’s amazing—until you realize that every time you ask AI to generate a haiku about your cat, it’s guzzling enough water to fill a swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Artificial intelligence, as it currently exists, is useful. As a technical tool, it&amp;rsquo;s downright phenomenal. I should be a fan of technology; after all, I spent the better half of my life as a network engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Changing Our Views on Success .</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#Learning to See What Truly Matters in Life&#xA;As I&amp;rsquo;ve emphasized before, nearly everything in life is subjective, and our concept of success is no exception. So, what does success mean? If you asked 100 different people about their idea of success, you&amp;rsquo;d likely get 100 distinct answers. For many, success is merely a reflection of one&amp;rsquo;s personal dreams or ultimate goals in life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Success can also be viewed through multiple lenses. What I mean by that is, success can be seen as an overall achievement, as well as individual accomplishments. A person may excel in companionship but struggle in other areas, yet still be considered successful as a parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;understanding-self-harm-35-years-later&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Self-Harm: 35 Years Later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the age of 12 until 23, I self-mutilated almost daily. I don’t know how I learned it—or if I even &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; learn it. And though, at the time, I thought I knew why, I never truly understood it. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I write here comes from experience and insight—a deeper understanding that arrived after years of avoidance, when I wasn’t searching for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The power of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a&#xA;  href=&#34;https://joshuagoth.com/learning-to-be-mindful/&#34;&#xA;  &#xA;  &gt;using meditation as a tool for self-discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; cannot be overstated. Meditation is peculiar; sometimes, you focus on solving one problem, only for a forgotten memory—buried for years—to surface unexpectedly. These revelations are priceless, life-altering, and come &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; when you’re ready to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-intelligence-artificial&#34;&gt;Is Intelligence Artificial?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI, in the sense most of us think of it, is a scary thought. There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding this topic, and for good reason. I feel we are rushing the technology instead of asking very fundamental questions. I am not speaking about morality, but basic psychology &amp;ndash; the stuff that makes us human.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a discussion with my daughter the other night about what constitutes a sentient being. She argues that a sentient being must be organic; it must have a soul. Valid argument, indeed. I am sure many of us feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My decision isn&amp;rsquo;t driven by a lack of interest or willingness to debate; rather, it stems from a profound understanding of politics&amp;rsquo; divisive nature. The truth is, politics can cleave even the most closely-knit relationships – families, friends, and loved ones – apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;every-moment-matters&#34;&gt;Every Moment Matters&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a parent, it can be overwhelming to navigate the ups and downs of raising your little ones. As parents, we don’t need added difficulties in the department of raising children, so those that suffer from mental health problems are fighting another battle altogether. More often than not, it’s not only the parent who suffers, but also the child (and this is where the cycle of abuse / violence./ neglect continues—or is born).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m no exception. But often, we see mistakes as a reflection of our own worthiness – and that&amp;rsquo;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing about mistakes – they might not feel like it at first, but they can actually be turning points for growth and learning. If only we can see them as chances to improve, rather than just failures to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#Changing Your World and The World Around You&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not reinventing the wheel, nor am I rebranding centuries of historical&amp;ndash;and agreed upon&amp;ndash; truths. All I am doing is simply acknowledging that it is there. Being mindful of existence, gives life to it. Makes the immaterial - matter. By knowing we have a place in history is like picking up a pencil midway in life in order to document, and pay attention to it. &amp;ndash; It has always been, but now, we are able to see it. To watch it grow, take shape and alter the world around ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am not a medical professional, and my advice should not be considered a substitute for professional assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those of you visiting, I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to tell you about the horrifying nature of depression. But for those who have not experienced it, let me assure you that it is not just sadness; it is so much more, and far worse. Put simply, depression can be described as an incurable cancer of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this part, I will focus on ways that loved ones and caregivers can support those who suffer from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could compile a lengthy list of things not to do when someone you love is experiencing a depressive episode based on my own experiences with less-than-understanding partners. However, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s more beneficial to focus on the positives. Here are some methods that have proven helpful for those supporting someone with depression:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After winning a 43-year battle with depression, I hoped the worst was behind me. However, I forgot about my age. Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with something that my 82-year-old Father-In-Law was diagnosed with, and had surgery for last year; Spinal Stenosis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am no spring chicken, but I hoped I would have another 40 years before something like this hit me. To say the least, it has been painful, and even more so with dealing with our healthcare system (In my opinion, health care should not be a private, for-profit entity).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a network veteran, I&amp;rsquo;m here to share some super valuable tips on how to minimize downtime in the workplace. After all, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a productive workday without those pesky IT issues getting in the way? Many of these are hard lessons I had to learn on my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stats-are-scary-but-honest&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stats are Scary (But Honest)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: downtime can be a major productivity killer. According to a report by IT Brand Pulse (1), 80% of businesses experience at least one hour of downtime per week, resulting in an average loss of $5,000 per minute! That&amp;rsquo;s a whole lotta money just sitting idle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The psychological toll it exacts can be devastating, and the longer one remains without a home, the deeper these mental wounds can become.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have found myself without a home more times than I care to write about. One of my earliest childhood memories was my mother bathing me in a sink at a homeless shelter, and within the last few years, alone in a ruined vehicle without a back window during one of the worst winters I have seen.The long term effects of being homeless are devistating. However, with proper support you can help recover from many traumas that homelessness can inflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of course, everyone&amp;rsquo;s situation is different, and therefore how we approach each situation is equally different. But for those of you who, like me, have an in-law (or parent) who refuses to listen, shuts down the moment the truth comes out, or just defies reality altogether, and have tried, for years, in every possible way to communicate; don&amp;rsquo;t throw in the towel just yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;from-the-eyes-of-a-25-year-network-engineer-veteran&#34;&gt;From The Eyes of a 25-Year Network Engineer, Veteran&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think back to high school, and think about life now. What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; school have taught you in order to help you prepare for the real world? The importance of having good credit? How to balance a checkbook? Budgeting and the basics of managing finances, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;College and careers, in relation, are no exception. There are things that you wish you were taught, or real-world knowledge in the field that books just never mentioned. I have separated this post into two distinct categories: Things that you needed to know but were never taught, and what you were never told about working in the industry. Some of what I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you may fall under the umbrella of the white-collar office life, in general, so I will try to be as specific as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-possibilities-of-dreams&#34;&gt;The Possibilities of Dreams&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could rehash scientific theories until I am blue in the face, but that is not what this post is about. Instead, I would like to share my thoughts and experiences on dreams.Since a life altering event during a time of homelessness in 2021, I have experienced dreams differently than I had before. I rarely have dreams of which I consider are my own (meaning people, events and setting are familiar). I no longer dream of my life. The events that transpire in my dreams happen in another time and place. The languages of each dream are of a tongue I have never heard, but do understand. The technologies are oftentimes nearly impossible to discribe, as though the place where I am, at the time, does not follow the laws of physics as we know them today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#The Path to Mindfulness and the Power of Change&#xA;Mindfulness is an extraordinary ability, bordering on the supernatural. Practicing mindfulness is akin to an intense mental workout at the gym, but instead of building physical strength, it enhances your mental capacities. Imagine having the power to regulate your heart rate, blood pressure, moods, perspectives, and interactions with people just by focusing your thoughts. This guide does not focus on wishing things into existence (although I encourage spreading positive energies for everyone), but rather provides a crash course in exercises designed to help you cultivate a stronger mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
