      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-love-affair-with-nintendo-is-becoming-a-new-project&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Love Affair with Nintendo is Becoming a New Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I have been a huge fan of Nintendo since I was about nine or ten years old. It all started on a Christmas morning back in 1988. I had just come home from the ER the day before after my first serious brush with death, and that morning, I unwrapped my first Nintendo Entertainment System. Call it what you will; Addiction or brain Damage, but from that moment on, there was simply no turning back. That gray box wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a toy; it was a portal to something that, like many others, helped shaped some of my childhood and the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
