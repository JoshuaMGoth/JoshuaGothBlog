      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-your-lens-limiting-you-how-to-change-your-perspective-for-a-better-life&#34;&gt;Is Your Lens Limiting You? How to Change Your Perspective for a Better Life&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt stuck? Like you’re running on a treadmill, putting in the effort but going absolutely nowhere? I have. For years, I was convinced my happiness was waiting just over the next hill—a promotion, a bigger house, a slimmer waistline. I was viewing my entire life through a lens of &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt;, and let me tell you, it was exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-alchemist--the-simple-power-of-a-great-book&#34;&gt;The Alchemist &amp;amp; The Simple Power of a Great Book&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of books in the world. Good books, bad books, and those we simply forget. But every now and then, if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, you find a book so profound it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just change your life—it reveals the answers to questions you&amp;rsquo;ve been carrying within you all along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paulo Coelho&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; is that kind of book. It&amp;rsquo;s a short read, barely 180 pages, but I urge you to treat it like all precious things: take your time. Savor it. Ingest its messages slowly and deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
