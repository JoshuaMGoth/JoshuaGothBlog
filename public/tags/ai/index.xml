      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;redefining-our-own-definition&#34;&gt;Redefining Our Own Definition&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in a prior post that humanity is a double-edged sword. We have the profound ability to create, matched only by our capacity to destroy. Our darkness can be as void and deep as our brightest, shining light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are masters of ingenuity, yet despite this, we seem unable to learn from our past mistakes. In other words, history keeps repeating itself. The single common denominator throughout the entire history of humankind is us: humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Our Responsibility in Creating Sentient Ai</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-creators-burden-why-ai-demands-a-new-human-rights-framework&#34;&gt;The Creator&amp;rsquo;s Burden: Why AI Demands a New Human Rights Framework&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Responsibility for Our Creations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I recently finished watching Guillermo del Toro&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a story that was always close to her heart from her college studies, but I never personally gave it much thought. That is, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog isn’t a review of &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it’s about a profound truth that struck me while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Our New Internet Old Extraterrestrial Technology?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;could-it-be-true&#34;&gt;Could it be True?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theories, the not-so-serious or non-political kind, serve as a mental break from work, much like recess time did in grade school. Pondering their merit, whether factual or not, is beside the point. As humans, we&amp;rsquo;re drawn to mysteries and &lt;em&gt;what-ifs&lt;/em&gt; in life. We enjoy daydreaming about an Undiscovered Country that only requires our time for refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;nothing-to-see-here-move-along&#34;&gt;Nothing To See Here. Move Along&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I mention &lt;em&gt;Roswell, NM&lt;/em&gt;, our thoughts instantly transform into a UFO crash—an event (&lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;non-event&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;) that took place in 1947. Alongside this image, we envision countless roadside diners in New Mexico displaying flying saucer logos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unquenchable AI. Our Thirst for Technology are Drinking the Rivers Dry.</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-who-cares-right&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(But Who Cares, Right?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you enjoying your seamless AI-powered life? You know, the one where you ask ChatGPT to write your emails, let Midjourney create your Instagram aesthetic, and rely on Google Assistant to remind you to drink water (ironic, isn’t it?). Isn’t it just &lt;em&gt;so convenient&lt;/em&gt; to have machines do all the thinking for us? Sure, it’s amazing—until you realize that every time you ask AI to generate a haiku about your cat, it’s guzzling enough water to fill a swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why True AI is a Bad Idea</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;we-need-to-think-this-through&#34;&gt;We Need to Think This Through&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I take any digs at artificial intelligence (as Hollywood portrays it and as we fear it), allow me to express that I am all for using technology to benefit us. Artificial intelligence, as it currently exists, is useful. As a technical tool, it&amp;rsquo;s downright phenomenal. I should be a fan of technology; after all, I spent the better half of my life as a network engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Artifical Intelligence is No Longer Artifical</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-intelligence-artificial&#34;&gt;Is Intelligence Artificial?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI, in the sense most of us think of it, is a scary thought. There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding this topic, and for good reason. I feel we are rushing the technology instead of asking very fundamental questions. I am not speaking about morality, but basic psychology &amp;ndash; the stuff that makes us human.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a discussion with my daughter the other night about what constitutes a sentient being. She argues that a sentient being must be organic; it must have a soul. Valid argument, indeed. I am sure many of us feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
