      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;from-the-eyes-of-a-25-year-network-engineer-veteran&#34;&gt;From The Eyes of a 25-Year Network Engineer, Veteran&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think back to high school, and think about life now. What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; school have taught you in order to help you prepare for the real world? The importance of having good credit? How to balance a checkbook? Budgeting and the basics of managing finances, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;College and careers, in relation, are no exception. There are things that you wish you were taught, or real-world knowledge in the field that books just never mentioned. I have separated this post into two distinct categories: Things that you needed to know but were never taught, and what you were never told about working in the industry. Some of what I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you may fall under the umbrella of the white-collar office life, in general, so I will try to be as specific as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
