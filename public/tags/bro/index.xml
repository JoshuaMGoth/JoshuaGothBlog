      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-shut-down-prompt-that-can-save-us-all&#34;&gt;A Shut-Down Prompt That Can &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt; Us All&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have memory problems. As one that suffers from CRS (cant remember sh!t), anything that I can use to aid my handicap from day-to-day, I am all for. As such, I forget to save things and end up losing work on a daily basis during the evenings shutdown of the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are countless sites with walkthroughs, guides, programs, etc, so I do my best as to not reinvent the wheel, and share things that I have found useful that there may not have had enough attention to gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
