      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-linux-command-line-shortcuts-that-will-make-you-10x-more-productive&#34;&gt;5 Linux Command Line Shortcuts That Will Make You 10x More Productive&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although having to work with Linux throughout my career, only within the last year have I switched to use Linux as a full-time, daily driver. Although very comfortable, I still consider myself a laymen (lacking in-depth knowledge of programming languages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted to share some commands that I picked up along the way that have made my every day life easier. I made a conscience effort&amp;ndash;in the early days of full-time Linux&amp;ndash; to stay away from the GUI, and unlock the power of the terminal / command line. This, by far, was the best choice I have made, as I cannot tell you the amount of control that I have (not to mention the time I have saved) when working on my many projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-journey-that-led-me-to-ditch-wordpress-for-hugo&#34;&gt;My Journey That Led Me to Ditch WordPress for Hugo&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After retiring from my career as a full-time network engineer, I began exploring new tech avenues as a hobby. A little over a year ago, I decided to take web development seriously. Little did I know, that decision would lead me on a path from frustration to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;first-steps-a-wordpress-nightmare&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Steps: A WordPress Nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget my first frustrating encounter with WordPress. I was nearly brought to tears trying to figure out why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just &lt;em&gt;drag and drop&lt;/em&gt; elements as I pleased! Despite that rocky start, I persevered. I worked hard, learned the ropes, and eventually built my first patchwork-style website. WordPress, as a CMS, is truly amazing for what it enables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
