      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;beyond-the-elite-how-ai-is-unlocking-potential-for-the-rest-of-us&#34;&gt;Beyond the Elite: How AI is Unlocking Potential for the Rest of Us&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest. For years, the narrative around technology and innovation felt like an exclusive club. You needed the right degree, the right connections, or, most dauntingly, the right bank account to even get a seat at the table. I know that feeling intimately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All my life I have invented things. I can look at an every day &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; and create an easier solution, modification, or a way to do something that hasnt been done yet. I thought this ability was a curse. Watching things that I have invented in my mind, or jotted down in my &amp;lsquo;idea&amp;rsquo; journal, just to watch it take shape by someone else, in time. I felt like I held the winning lottery ticket, but without any way to cash it in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
