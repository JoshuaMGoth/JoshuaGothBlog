      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;humanity-a-double-edged-sword&#34;&gt;Humanity: A Double-Edged Sword&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humanity is a double-edged sword. Our ingenuity goes hand-in-hand with our stupidity; of that, I am sure we can all agree. But why? Why do we choose &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to fix what is? Why do those in power consistently fail to make the choices that would better society, and instead only better themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plainly put, we have the resources to solve nearly every problem on earth, yet we &lt;strong&gt;choose&lt;/strong&gt; not to. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s merely my own personal lack of understanding, but if I were in a position of insurmountable wealth, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do everything I could to keep society down. I would focus on ensuring the survival of our species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
