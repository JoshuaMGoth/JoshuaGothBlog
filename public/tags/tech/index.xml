      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;redefining-our-own-definition&#34;&gt;Redefining Our Own Definition&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in a prior post that humanity is a double-edged sword. We have the profound ability to create, matched only by our capacity to destroy. Our darkness can be as void and deep as our brightest, shining light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are masters of ingenuity, yet despite this, we seem unable to learn from our past mistakes. In other words, history keeps repeating itself. The single common denominator throughout the entire history of humankind is us: humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Our Responsibility in Creating Sentient Ai</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-creators-burden-why-ai-demands-a-new-human-rights-framework&#34;&gt;The Creator&amp;rsquo;s Burden: Why AI Demands a New Human Rights Framework&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Responsibility for Our Creations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I recently finished watching Guillermo del Toro&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a story that was always close to her heart from her college studies, but I never personally gave it much thought. That is, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog isn’t a review of &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it’s about a profound truth that struck me while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Gave Up Windows for Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;trading-up-to-linux-why-i-dumped-windows&#34;&gt;Trading up to Linux. Why I dumped Windows.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, I know what I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means I am aware that there is a whole lot going on behind the scenes that I am not privy to and, furthermore, can do little to change. Crypticism aside, what it all boils down to, at least for me, is &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;major-trust-issues&#34;&gt;Major Trust Issues&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have trust issues, and rightfully so. I have hacked and been hacked. I have gained and I have lost. My journey toward taking security seriously, on a personal level, went far beyond the methods I employed and trained in while working as a network engineer for the better half of my career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Our New Internet Old Extraterrestrial Technology?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;could-it-be-true&#34;&gt;Could it be True?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theories, the not-so-serious or non-political kind, serve as a mental break from work, much like recess time did in grade school. Pondering their merit, whether factual or not, is beside the point. As humans, we&amp;rsquo;re drawn to mysteries and &lt;em&gt;what-ifs&lt;/em&gt; in life. We enjoy daydreaming about an Undiscovered Country that only requires our time for refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;nothing-to-see-here-move-along&#34;&gt;Nothing To See Here. Move Along&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I mention &lt;em&gt;Roswell, NM&lt;/em&gt;, our thoughts instantly transform into a UFO crash—an event (&lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;non-event&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;) that took place in 1947. Alongside this image, we envision countless roadside diners in New Mexico displaying flying saucer logos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unquenchable AI. Our Thirst for Technology are Drinking the Rivers Dry.</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-who-cares-right&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(But Who Cares, Right?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you enjoying your seamless AI-powered life? You know, the one where you ask ChatGPT to write your emails, let Midjourney create your Instagram aesthetic, and rely on Google Assistant to remind you to drink water (ironic, isn’t it?). Isn’t it just &lt;em&gt;so convenient&lt;/em&gt; to have machines do all the thinking for us? Sure, it’s amazing—until you realize that every time you ask AI to generate a haiku about your cat, it’s guzzling enough water to fill a swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why True AI is a Bad Idea</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;we-need-to-think-this-through&#34;&gt;We Need to Think This Through&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I take any digs at artificial intelligence (as Hollywood portrays it and as we fear it), allow me to express that I am all for using technology to benefit us. Artificial intelligence, as it currently exists, is useful. As a technical tool, it&amp;rsquo;s downright phenomenal. I should be a fan of technology; after all, I spent the better half of my life as a network engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Artifical Intelligence is No Longer Artifical</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-intelligence-artificial&#34;&gt;Is Intelligence Artificial?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI, in the sense most of us think of it, is a scary thought. There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding this topic, and for good reason. I feel we are rushing the technology instead of asking very fundamental questions. I am not speaking about morality, but basic psychology &amp;ndash; the stuff that makes us human.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a discussion with my daughter the other night about what constitutes a sentient being. She argues that a sentient being must be organic; it must have a soul. Valid argument, indeed. I am sure many of us feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-land-a-job-in-it-without-prior-work-experience&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Land a Job in IT Without Prior Work Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting hired can be difficult enough, but getting hired without any experience is damn near impossible. After all, how can you get hired without experience in order to obtain the experience you need in order to get hired in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope to answer that question for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will be writing this with the assumption that you do not have any work history, a fresh degree, and not a whole lot of real world experience. Please pick and choose what applies to your unique situation according to your skill set and what you feel comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lessons-learned-from-a-25-year-network-engineer-veteran&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned from a 25-Year Network Engineer, Veteran&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey there, fellow network enthusiasts! As a network veteran, I&amp;rsquo;m here to share some super valuable tips on how to minimize downtime in the workplace. After all, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a productive workday without those pesky IT issues getting in the way? Many of these are hard lessons I had to learn on my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stats-are-scary-but-honest&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stats are Scary (But Honest)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: downtime can be a major productivity killer. According to a report by IT Brand Pulse (1), 80% of businesses experience at least one hour of downtime per week, resulting in an average loss of $5,000 per minute! That&amp;rsquo;s a whole lotta money just sitting idle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What to Expect When Starting a Career in Technology</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;from-the-eyes-of-a-25-year-network-engineer-veteran&#34;&gt;From The Eyes of a 25-Year Network Engineer, Veteran&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think back to high school, and think about life now. What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; school have taught you in order to help you prepare for the real world? The importance of having good credit? How to balance a checkbook? Budgeting and the basics of managing finances, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;College and careers, in relation, are no exception. There are things that you wish you were taught, or real-world knowledge in the field that books just never mentioned. I have separated this post into two distinct categories: Things that you needed to know but were never taught, and what you were never told about working in the industry. Some of what I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you may fall under the umbrella of the white-collar office life, in general, so I will try to be as specific as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
