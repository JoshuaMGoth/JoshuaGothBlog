In this part, I will focus on ways that loved ones and caregivers can support those who suffer from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could compile a lengthy list of things not to do when someone you love is experiencing a depressive episode based on my own experiences with less-than-understanding partners. However, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s more beneficial to focus on the positives. Here are some methods that have proven helpful for those supporting someone with depression:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
