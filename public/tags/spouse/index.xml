      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;from-enmeshment-to-empowerment-navigating-a-parentified-spouse-dynamic&#34;&gt;From Enmeshment to Empowerment: Navigating a Parentified Spouse Dynamic&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about a kind of relationship weight you can’t see on a scale. It’s the weight of expectation, of history, of a role you never auditioned for but somehow ended up playing every single day. For years, I thought my marriage was just… &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. Harder than the movies promised. Harder than my friends’ partnerships seemed. The arguments weren’t about leaving the toilet seat up or spending too much money; they were deep, cyclical, and felt strangely parental. I’d find myself exasperated, saying things like, “For heaven’s sake, just think for yourself!” or feeling a simmering resentment when I had to manage yet another basic life task for my otherwise competent, intelligent partner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
