      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;every-moment-matters&#34;&gt;Every Moment Matters&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a parent, it can be overwhelming to navigate the ups and downs of raising your little ones. As parents, we don’t need added difficulties in the department of raising children, so those that suffer from mental health problems are fighting another battle altogether. More often than not, it’s not only the parent who suffers, but also the child (and this is where the cycle of abuse / violence./ neglect continues—or is born).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Becoming Mindful. Choosing the Path to a Better Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#The Path to Mindfulness and the Power of Change&#xA;Mindfulness is an extraordinary ability, bordering on the supernatural. Practicing mindfulness is akin to an intense mental workout at the gym, but instead of building physical strength, it enhances your mental capacities. Imagine having the power to regulate your heart rate, blood pressure, moods, perspectives, and interactions with people just by focusing your thoughts. This guide does not focus on wishing things into existence (although I encourage spreading positive energies for everyone), but rather provides a crash course in exercises designed to help you cultivate a stronger mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
