      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;family-drama---episode-2&#34;&gt;Family Drama - Episode 2&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracking the Code&lt;/strong&gt;. In an earlier blog, I discussed some common reasons why difficult family members shut down when you attempt to communicate with them, and explode when approached with the truth about themselves. In Part 2, I now discuss proven psychological methods and examples on how to safely approach them in order to effectively communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Apply the Truth-Telling Principles With Shut-Down Family Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
