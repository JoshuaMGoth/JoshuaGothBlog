      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;minimizing-hardships-what-tough-times-really-mean&#34;&gt;Minimizing Hardships: What Tough Times Really Mean&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have all said it, and I feel the majority of us know what difficult times are—or do we?&#xA;Why must we always prepare ourselves &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; difficult times to come? What are we really conditioning ourselves for?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ask-yourself-have-times-ever-truly-been-easy&#34;&gt;Ask yourself: Have Times Ever Truly Been Easy?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking for myself, I am unable to recall any time in my life that was genuinely easy. Of course, looking back, I can identify periods that were &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; than others, but were any of those times truly &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Changing Our Views on Success .</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#Learning to See What Truly Matters in Life&#xA;As I&amp;rsquo;ve emphasized before, nearly everything in life is subjective, and our concept of success is no exception. So, what does success mean? If you asked 100 different people about their idea of success, you&amp;rsquo;d likely get 100 distinct answers. For many, success is merely a reflection of one&amp;rsquo;s personal dreams or ultimate goals in life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Success can also be viewed through multiple lenses. What I mean by that is, success can be seen as an overall achievement, as well as individual accomplishments. A person may excel in companionship but struggle in other areas, yet still be considered successful as a parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#Changing Your World and The World Around You&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not reinventing the wheel, nor am I rebranding centuries of historical&amp;ndash;and agreed upon&amp;ndash; truths. All I am doing is simply acknowledging that it is there. Being mindful of existence, gives life to it. Makes the immaterial - matter. By knowing we have a place in history is like picking up a pencil midway in life in order to document, and pay attention to it. &amp;ndash; It has always been, but now, we are able to see it. To watch it grow, take shape and alter the world around ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;living-with-depression-part-1&#34;&gt;Living &lt;em&gt;With&lt;/em&gt; Depression (Part 1)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost: I&amp;rsquo;d like to begin by stating that if you are in danger of hurting yourself or others, please call the Crisis Lifeline at 988 (@988lifeline) for help. I am not a medical professional, and my advice should not be considered a substitute for professional assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those of you visiting, I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to tell you about the horrifying nature of depression. But for those who have not experienced it, let me assure you that it is not just sadness; it is so much more, and far worse. Put simply, depression can be described as an incurable cancer of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;living-with-depression-part-2&#34;&gt;Living &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; Depression (Part 2)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this series, I discussed methods that have helped me in my personal journey to manage depression. In this part, I will focus on ways that loved ones and caregivers can support those who suffer from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could compile a lengthy list of things not to do when someone you love is experiencing a depressive episode based on my own experiences with less-than-understanding partners. However, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s more beneficial to focus on the positives. Here are some methods that have proven helpful for those supporting someone with depression:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
