      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-years-lost-and-20-years-taken&#34;&gt;10 Years Lost and 20 Years Taken.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel it’s best to kick off this new site with a story. I promise, it won’t take long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A ghost. A recluse. Once the center of events, I had withdrawn from everything that I knew and loved. It was not by choice. Not at first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, I was poisoned with pride. Magnetic. Charismatic. Having come from the streets, I pulled myself out of places where hope held no domain to having everything that I had wanted. I was at the peak of my career as a Network Engineer. Flashy new German cars. All the toys I could possibly flaunt, and everything I needed to stay on top of all of my hobbies. I was the center of envy, and that nourished me around every turn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
