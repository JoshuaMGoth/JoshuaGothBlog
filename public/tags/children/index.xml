      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;breaking-the-cycle-when-your-spouse-feels-obligated-to-their-parents-and-siblings&#34;&gt;Breaking the Cycle: When Your Spouse Feels Obligated to Their Parents and Siblings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey there. Let’s talk about something that doesn’t get enough airtime in the “happy marriage” playbook: what happens when your partner’s sense of duty to their family of origin starts feeling like a third wheel in your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You know the scene. A planned date night gets canceled for a last-minute sibling crisis. A significant chunk of your savings is quietly redirected to help a parent, without a conversation. You feel like you’re constantly competing for your spouse’s attention, and the competitors are their mom, dad, brother, or sister. It’s not that they don’t love you—it’s that an invisible, powerful sense of &lt;strong&gt;obligation&lt;/strong&gt; is calling the shots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-price-of-love&#34;&gt;The Price of Love&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going to kick off a series that may hit home for a lot of folks. Its about the damage that too much love can cause your child in the long run. Like any story that I am hit with, this woke me up at 4:30 in the morning after a night of meditating about my in-laws, and the damage that being an over-protective parent can do. Like many, I am doing all I can to keep a pair of adult men who were never taught how to care for themselves from showing up at my door in their early 40&amp;rsquo;s, looking for a place to live. But my frustration doesnt compare the the amount of suffering that my wife is enduring. Like any supportive spouse, I know that in order to help, I need to understand, so allow me to share what I have learned in this series in hopes it can help you, as well. . . But first, a story. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;every-moment-matters&#34;&gt;Every Moment Matters&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a parent, it can be overwhelming to navigate the ups and downs of raising your little ones. As parents, we don’t need added difficulties in the department of raising children, so those that suffer from mental health problems are fighting another battle altogether. More often than not, it’s not only the parent who suffers, but also the child (and this is where the cycle of abuse / violence./ neglect continues—or is born).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
