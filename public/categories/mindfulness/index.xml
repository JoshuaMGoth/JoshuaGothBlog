      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-alchemist--the-simple-power-of-a-great-book&#34;&gt;The Alchemist &amp;amp; The Simple Power of a Great Book&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of books in the world. Good books, bad books, and those we simply forget. But every now and then, if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, you find a book so profound it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just change your life—it reveals the answers to questions you&amp;rsquo;ve been carrying within you all along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paulo Coelho&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; is that kind of book. It&amp;rsquo;s a short read, barely 180 pages, but I urge you to treat it like all precious things: take your time. Savor it. Ingest its messages slowly and deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-bodys-secret-the-unlikely-technique-that-healed-what-doctors-couldnt&#34;&gt;My Body&amp;rsquo;s Secret: The Unlikely Technique That Healed What Doctors Couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Late last year I was diagnosed with Upper and Lower Spinal Stenosis. For those of you unfamiliar with this condition, it essentially means that the sockets in between the bones in my spine have worn down and the vertebrae are grinding against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like normal wear and tear on an aged automobile, this is a condition that many people suffer from. The only issue that I had with this, was that it is usually diagnosed in the elderly, ages 80+. Put simply, I have put far too many miles on this engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;minimizing-hardships-what-tough-times-really-mean&#34;&gt;Minimizing Hardships: What Tough Times Really Mean&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have all said it, and I feel the majority of us know what difficult times are—or do we?&#xA;Why must we always prepare ourselves &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; difficult times to come? What are we really conditioning ourselves for?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ask-yourself-have-times-ever-truly-been-easy&#34;&gt;Ask yourself: Have Times Ever Truly Been Easy?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking for myself, I am unable to recall any time in my life that was genuinely easy. Of course, looking back, I can identify periods that were &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; than others, but were any of those times truly &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SNAP Benefit Cuts: Making Food Last</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;navigating-the-november-snap-cuts-a-survival-guide&#34;&gt;Navigating the November SNAP cuts: A Survival Guide&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have always been two subjects I try to stay away from: religion—which I know a great deal about—and politics, something I have chosen to avoid due to the divide opinions can cause.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve kept my head in the sand, intentionally steering clear of what is happening in America, as though by some magic, I would not be affected by it. I was wrong. It is affecting me and has been for some time. Now, myself, along with 44 million other Americans who rely on SNAP assistance to feed our families, finds that November will be a very difficult month for many of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Changing Our Views on Success .</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2025/10/changing-our-views-on-success-./</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#Learning to See What Truly Matters in Life&#xA;As I&amp;rsquo;ve emphasized before, nearly everything in life is subjective, and our concept of success is no exception. So, what does success mean? If you asked 100 different people about their idea of success, you&amp;rsquo;d likely get 100 distinct answers. For many, success is merely a reflection of one&amp;rsquo;s personal dreams or ultimate goals in life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Success can also be viewed through multiple lenses. What I mean by that is, success can be seen as an overall achievement, as well as individual accomplishments. A person may excel in companionship but struggle in other areas, yet still be considered successful as a parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Political Divide in America</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-true-cost-of-politics-a-call-to-unite&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The True Cost of Politics: A Call to Unite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I navigate the complexities of our society, I&amp;rsquo;m compelled to acknowledge that I don&amp;rsquo;t engage in political discussions. My decision isn&amp;rsquo;t driven by a lack of interest or willingness to debate; rather, it stems from a profound understanding of politics&amp;rsquo; divisive nature. The truth is, politics can cleave even the most closely-knit relationships – families, friends, and loved ones – apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Mindfulness Puts You on The Path to Become a Great Parent</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;every-moment-matters&#34;&gt;Every Moment Matters&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a parent, it can be overwhelming to navigate the ups and downs of raising your little ones. As parents, we don’t need added difficulties in the department of raising children, so those that suffer from mental health problems are fighting another battle altogether. More often than not, it’s not only the parent who suffers, but also the child (and this is where the cycle of abuse / violence./ neglect continues—or is born).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Saticlysm Philosophy. A Simple Way of Living</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#Changing Your World and The World Around You&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not reinventing the wheel, nor am I rebranding centuries of historical&amp;ndash;and agreed upon&amp;ndash; truths. All I am doing is simply acknowledging that it is there. Being mindful of existence, gives life to it. Makes the immaterial - matter. By knowing we have a place in history is like picking up a pencil midway in life in order to document, and pay attention to it. &amp;ndash; It has always been, but now, we are able to see it. To watch it grow, take shape and alter the world around ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Becoming Mindful. Choosing the Path to a Better Life</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2025/07/becoming-mindful.-choosing-the-path-to-a-better-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#The Path to Mindfulness and the Power of Change&#xA;Mindfulness is an extraordinary ability, bordering on the supernatural. Practicing mindfulness is akin to an intense mental workout at the gym, but instead of building physical strength, it enhances your mental capacities. Imagine having the power to regulate your heart rate, blood pressure, moods, perspectives, and interactions with people just by focusing your thoughts. This guide does not focus on wishing things into existence (although I encourage spreading positive energies for everyone), but rather provides a crash course in exercises designed to help you cultivate a stronger mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
