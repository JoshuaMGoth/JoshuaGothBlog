      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-price-of-love&#34;&gt;The Price of Love&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going to kick off a series that may hit home for a lot of folks. Its about the damage that too much love can cause your child in the long run. Like any story that I am hit with, this woke me up at 4:30 in the morning after a night of meditating about my in-laws, and the damage that being an over-protective parent can do. Like many, I am doing all I can to keep a pair of adult men who were never taught how to care for themselves from showing up at my door in their early 40&amp;rsquo;s, looking for a place to live. But my frustration doesnt compare the the amount of suffering that my wife is enduring. Like any supportive spouse, I know that in order to help, I need to understand, so allow me to share what I have learned in this series in hopes it can help you, as well. . . But first, a story. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;family-drama---episode-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Drama - Episode 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I have trouble with my in-laws. Of course, everyone&amp;rsquo;s situation is different, and therefore how we approach each situation is equally different. But for those of you who, like me, have an in-law (or parent) who refuses to listen, shuts down the moment the truth comes out, or just defies reality altogether, and have tried, for years, in every possible way to communicate; don&amp;rsquo;t throw in the towel just yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;family-drama---episode-2&#34;&gt;Family Drama - Episode 2&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracking the Code&lt;/strong&gt;. In an earlier blog, I discussed some common reasons why difficult family members shut down when you attempt to communicate with them, and explode when approached with the truth about themselves. In Part 2, I now discuss proven psychological methods and examples on how to safely approach them in order to effectively communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Apply the Truth-Telling Principles With Shut-Down Family Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
