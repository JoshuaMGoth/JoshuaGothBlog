      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-shut-down-prompt-that-can-save-us-all&#34;&gt;A Shut-Down Prompt That Can &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt; Us All&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have memory problems. As one that suffers from CRS (cant remember sh!t), anything that I can use to aid my handicap from day-to-day, I am all for. As such, I forget to save things and end up losing work on a daily basis during the evenings shutdown of the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are countless sites with walkthroughs, guides, programs, etc, so I do my best as to not reinvent the wheel, and share things that I have found useful that there may not have had enough attention to gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-linux-command-line-shortcuts-that-will-make-you-10x-more-productive&#34;&gt;5 Linux Command Line Shortcuts That Will Make You 10x More Productive&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although having to work with Linux throughout my career, only within the last year have I switched to use Linux as a full-time, daily driver. Although very comfortable, I still consider myself a laymen (lacking in-depth knowledge of programming languages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted to share some commands that I picked up along the way that have made my every day life easier. I made a conscience effort&amp;ndash;in the early days of full-time Linux&amp;ndash; to stay away from the GUI, and unlock the power of the terminal / command line. This, by far, was the best choice I have made, as I cannot tell you the amount of control that I have (not to mention the time I have saved) when working on my many projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;trading-up-to-linux-why-i-dumped-windows&#34;&gt;Trading up to Linux. Why I dumped Windows.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, I know what I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means I am aware that there is a whole lot going on behind the scenes that I am not privy to and, furthermore, can do little to change. Crypticism aside, what it all boils down to, at least for me, is &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;major-trust-issues&#34;&gt;Major Trust Issues&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have trust issues, and rightfully so. I have hacked and been hacked. I have gained and I have lost. My journey toward taking security seriously, on a personal level, went far beyond the methods I employed and trained in while working as a network engineer for the better half of my career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
