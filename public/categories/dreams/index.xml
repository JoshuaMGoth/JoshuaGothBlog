      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-possibilities-of-dreams&#34;&gt;The Possibilities of Dreams&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could rehash scientific theories until I am blue in the face, but that is not what this post is about. Instead, I would like to share my thoughts and experiences on dreams.Since a life altering event during a time of homelessness in 2021, I have experienced dreams differently than I had before. I rarely have dreams of which I consider are my own (meaning people, events and setting are familiar). I no longer dream of my life. The events that transpire in my dreams happen in another time and place. The languages of each dream are of a tongue I have never heard, but do understand. The technologies are oftentimes nearly impossible to discribe, as though the place where I am, at the time, does not follow the laws of physics as we know them today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
