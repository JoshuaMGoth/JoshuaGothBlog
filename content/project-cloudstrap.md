Welcome. If curiosity brought you are here, then allow me to fill you in on what *Project Cloudstrap* is, what it's about, and where it came from. I hope to not only explain what it means when you land on an application **"Powered by Project Cloud-Strap"**, but what it means to ***me.***
### So, What is it?

Put simply, Project Cloudstrap means doing the improbable—or at least attempting to. It is a driven dream. If this were Metaphysics, the project could be called Creatio ex nihile (creation from nothing). It's about creating something without any help, financial resources, guidance, etc, using only what is currently available to you. It means doing it completely--from start to finish--on your own. 
### The Idea Behind the Project
The Idea behind Project Cloudstrap started off as of an experiment of sorts. It began on a late November evening when I went to pickup a medication refill at my local drug-store. My grand total, was 54 cents. For most, this is a laughable amount of money, however, my card was declined. After being surprised by a series of forgotten bank-drafts, I had exactly 25 cents remaining in my bank account.

But the reality of the situation did not affect me as it would have in the past. I didn't beat myself up or feel sorry for myself. Instead, I looked at this as an opportunity, and that's when I was gifted with the idea:

***Build your ideas, sites, and services without any funding, help, or outside support. See how far a project can be taken without much, if any prior knowledge on subjects which you have no former education or training. Use the tools available to you. Prove that all you need are two things: A dream; and a drive to make it happen.***

It was then that I realized that, with the internet, flying with nothing more than an AI co-pilot and a dream, I had every tool I needed in order to turn imagination into reality. 
### Whats with the name 'Cloudstrap'?

Project Cloudstrap is a combination of '[Project'](`https://www.score.org/blog/doing-business-dba-what-it-and-do-you-need-one`  "A route taken when one chooses tests the waters in order to be sure that this is a viable option, financially, for a new business.  Labeling a new business as a project is a legal safeguard that is used before registering a DBA"), '[Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream "Dual Meaning: Dream & Tech cloud")', and '[bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping "To build using only existing resources")'. 25Cent.Cloud is the first of many projects, aptly named at the time due to my account balance and a dream. It serves as a personal reminder that anything is possible. 

However, I will not gauge the successes or failures of any project of mine against the prospective, or current, monetary value.  If the application exists, functions, and is used, then the project was a success. 

So, with that said, I hope you understand that when you see anything that is powered by *Project Cloudstrap*, you know it was built against all odds, determination, and passion. By supporting Project Cloudstrap builds, you are supporting small people with big dreams.

Thank you,
Joshua M. Goth
