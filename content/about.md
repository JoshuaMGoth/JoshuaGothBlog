## Who Are Any of Us, Really?

Hi. Like you, I am a *real* person, and like to talk about *real* life. You know, *real* subjects from a *real* point of view. I say things how they *really* are, because that is how life *really* is. I like to discuss *real* problems, and *real* methods on how to solve those problems. I like to discuss things that matter. I like to discuss things that don't. I have seen how *real* this life can get, and because of that, I want to share with you *real* stories, lessons, and wisdom that I have gained from these events. 

Also like you, I have good days. I have bad. I laugh. I cry. I dream. I do my best to enjoy every moment that we have on this earth, with the little time we have it. I am a loving husband and father. I invent things. I create. I write. I'm a retired Network Engineer. I learn. I grow. I keep house. I work hard. I play hard. I never take anything too seriously, or personally. I have lived. I have died. I still struggle to get by. 

#### I am happy.


I could list my successes and failures. I could tell you my first memories are of my father trying to kill my mother and me, or that I spent much of my childhood without anything resembling stability. I could say that, in spite of statistics, I built a life for myself—proof that those born into abuse can not only escape but become devoted partners and parents.

But what do you truly want to know? I won't sell you a curated story. Instead, I will write with honesty about what I know, from cold streets to twelve-bedroom estates: the lessons that crafted me into the person I am today.

I am committed to being real with you. I will discuss difficult topics and share the insights that not only helped me excel despite of my mental ailments but also taught me how to heal from the same afflictions of which I was told there was no cure. This is a journey of discovering answers to questions, that only recently, did I understand how to ask. 

Simply put: I write about what I know. And for what I don't, I am honest and strive to learn. The topics I cover are close to my heart, ranging from and including:

· Philosophy and Mindfulness
· Mental Health and Parenting
· Depression and Self-Harm
· Drug Addiction and Homelessness
· From Having it all, to Nothing at All

I will share personal triumphs and hard-won knowledge that would have saved me loads of grief over my 25-year career as a Network Engineer, had someone bothered to share with me what I look forward to sharing with you.

This blog doesn't fit a single topic, genre, or niche. I am not here to sell you anything or lure you with clickbait. I strive to deliver the highest quality content that I can, but I make mistakes, and I am still learning. Everything I could call mmine in this life, I had earned. I take that to heart. And with that, I promise that everything that I post comes from me, and is not AI generated fodder. I want you to hear my voice as you read, the soul that I put behind my stories, and that is not something that a computer can do (at this time). 

However, being perfectly transparent, I do use AI as a tool to aid my personal shortcomings. While writing is a passion, I openly admit I still struggle with grammar, proper use of pronouns, and other things I probably should have learned during my adolence. Without a full-time editor, armed only with a degree in computer science--and although I activly work on my growth in that department-- I am happy to admit I am still learning, far from perfect, and not pretending to be something other than who I am.

I invite you to listen with an open mind and heart. Once again, my goal is not just to tell you who I am, but to show you—through lessons learned from a hopeless past filled with pain, sorrow, and unimaginable hardship.

This is my journey of refusal: the refusal to quit, the refusal to stay down, and the refusal to give up on someone I once believed never mattered... myself.

So, let's be real. I am *really* happy you are here.
