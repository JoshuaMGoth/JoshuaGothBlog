# Hello, everyone!

A quick and honest note from me today. I’m working on growing this blog's reach, and am thrilled with things I plan to add and to do in order to help and entertain. The most powerful way you can help is, of course by sharing. If you read a post that resonates with you or think it could help a friend or loved one, please pass it along. Sharing these posts is the best way to help increase traffic which will, in turn, aid to keep my blog online. 

#### Please Understand. . . 
My goal isn't to bathe in money—it's simply to afford the "web time" to keep this site online. The tools I use (since I'm a Linux nut, much of my daily drivers are free, but most of the needed ones, I have to cough up coin for) and hosting needed to run it are quietly racking up, and as you know, times are tough.

To that end, I’ve set up a **[Buy Me Some Web Time](https://buymeacoffee.com/joshuagoth)** link. If you feel compelled to support financially, any contribution goes directly toward keeping the lights on[^1]

Thank you so much for the time you’ve spent here. It means the world, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon.

#### ~Cheers,  
Joshua
	

[^1]: If you have the choice between sparing some change or buying a book or tool I’ve referenced in my posts—please invest in yourself first. Buying those resources helps you, which in turn helps others. (For clarity, unless stated otherwise, I’m not affiliated with any products or books I mention. I hope to earn affiliate links for future guides, but as of now, I have none.)
