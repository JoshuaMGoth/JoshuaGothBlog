# Navigating the November SNAP cuts: A Survival Guide


There have always been two subjects I try to stay away from: religion—which I know a great deal about—and politics, something I have chosen to avoid due to the divide opinions can cause.

I've kept my head in the sand, intentionally steering clear of what is happening in America, as though by some magic, I would not be affected by it. I was wrong. It is affecting me and has been for some time. Now, myself, along with 44 million other Americans who rely on SNAP assistance to feed our families, finds that November will be a very difficult month for many of us.

The fact of the matter is that those who are in need are being made to suffer even more, making 2025 feel more like 1930 to many Americans. The gap between the rich and poor continues to grow alongside the cost of living.

This will be the first post in a new "Survival Series," where I will list the services and tips I have personally used to survive difficult times. Stay tuned!



## The Foundations of Bulk Buying

### The Core Grains

**Rice**: White rice (jasmine, basmati, long-grain) lasts for decades in a cool, dark place when stored in airtight containers with oxygen absorbents. Brown rice has more nutrients but contains oils that can go rancid within 6-12 months.

**Dried Beans & Lentils**: An incredible source of protein and fiber. Lentils cook quickly, while beans like black, pinto, kidney, and chickpeas are versatile and last for years.

**Oats**: Rolled or "old-fashioned" oats are very cheap, nutritious, and can be used for much more than just breakfast porridge (e.g., granola, smoothies, meatloaf binder).

**Pasta**: Dried pasta is a classic for a reason. It's shelf-stable for years and is a quick, filling base for meals. 

**Popcorn Kernels**: Don't forget this one! It's a whole grain, and buying kernels in bulk is astronomically cheaper than microwave bags. It stores for 1-2 years.

**Quinoa**: While historically more expensive, buying in bulk can make it more affordable. It's a complete protein and cooks quickly.

### Preserved Proteins

**Canned Tuna, Chicken, or Salmon**: A fantastic source of ready-to-eat protein with a long shelf life.

**Canned Beans**: While slightly more expensive per unit than dried, they are a huge time-saver and still very affordable. Keep some for when you're in a pinch.

**Peanut Butter (& Other Nut Butters)**: A calorie-dense source of protein and healthy fats. Look for large jars or those you can scoop from bulk bins.

**Jerky**: While expensive, buying a large bag can be cheaper per ounce than small convenience store packs. It's a great survival-style protein.


### Preserved & Dehydrated Vegetables/Fruits


**Canned Tomatoes (Diced, Crushed, Paste)**: The backbone of countless sauces, soups, and stews. Arguably one of the most useful bulk items.

**Canned Vegetables**: Corn, green beans, and carrots are good to have on hand, though frozen often retains more nutrients.

**Potatoes**: Russet potatoes, stored in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated place (not the fridge!), can last for months.

**Onions & Garlic**: Buy a large mesh bag. Stored properly (cool, dark, dry with airflow), they can last for weeks or even months.

**Frozen Vegetables**: Buying large bags of frozen broccoli, peas, mixed vegetables, and spinach is extremely cost-effective and nutritious. They last for 8-12 months in the freezer.

**Dehydrated/Freeze-Dried Vegetables**: Things like dried mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers are lightweight, shelf-stable, and great for adding flavor to dishes.

**Dried Fruits**: Raisins, apricots, and cranberries are great for snacks, baking, and oatmeal. Buy large bags or from bulk bins.


### Baking & Pantry Staples

**Flour (All-Purpose & Whole Wheat)**: All-purpose flour can last over a year if stored in an airtight container to prevent pests and moisture. Whole wheat flour should be used faster (a few months) or stored in the freezer due to its oil content. There are many bread recipes that can be found online. With very little effort and flour, you can make a loaf of bread that will help fill hungry bellies, helping everyone get a good night's sleep.

**Sugar (White, Brown, Powdered)**: Sugar lasts indefinitely if kept dry. It's essential for baking and preserving.

**Salt**: A cheap and eternal mineral. Buy a large box of kosher or sea salt for cooking.

**Cooking Oils**: Vegetable, canola, and olive oil are staples. They have a shelf life of 1-2 years.

**Vinegar (White, Apple Cider)**: Vinegar is a self-preserving product that lasts for years. It's great for dressings, pickling, and cleaning.

**Broths & Bouillon**: Look for jars of better-than-bouillon or large boxes of broth when on sale.

**Spices & Herbs**: While not "bulk" in the same way, buying larger containers or from bulk bins is far cheaper per ounce than the tiny jars at the supermarket.


### We Will Endure
Times are tough, and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of relief in sight for many. All we can do, for now, is tighten our belts. It is a time to be mindful and grateful for the things we do have and often take for granted. Know that you are not the only person who is suffering during these times. So be kind, be helpful, and be patient. Maybe we can all come out of this together
