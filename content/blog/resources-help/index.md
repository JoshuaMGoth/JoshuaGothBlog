    [Utility discounts (if applicable)](https://www.seattle.gov/utilities/your-services/discounts-and-incentives/utility-discount-program#En_x162078 "Utility, Water Discounts") vary by city, and each provider has its own eligibility requirements. It’s always a good idea to call your local provider directly to see what assistance programs they offer.

If you already have an unlocked phone (one that's fully paid off), many providers can send you a SIM card or use an eSIM instead.
    

**Food Assistance**

    If you find yourself out of work or unable to afford health insurance, [Medicaid Health Insurance](https://www.hca.wa.gov/free-or-low-cost-health-care/apply-or-renew-coverage "Free Health Care") may be an option. Coverage can often start the same day you apply. The specific insurance companies under Medicaid can differ from state to state, so we suggest searching for "Medicaid" in your state to get started.
    

**Immediate & Crisis Help**

- **Dial 2-1-1 for Local Resources**  
    For immediate help finding emergency shelter, food, transportation, and other critical resources, you can call 2-1-1. This is a free, confidential service available in many areas. In In King County, WA, [Call 2-1-1](tel:211 "2.1.1") or [Toll Free](tel:1-800-621-4636 "1.800.621.4636"). Services vary by state but generally offer similar ways to connect people with the help they need.
