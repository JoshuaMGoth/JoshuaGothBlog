# Minimizing Hardships: What Tough Times Really Mean

We have all said it, and I feel the majority of us know what difficult times are—or do we?
Why must we always prepare ourselves _for_ difficult times to come? What are we really conditioning ourselves for?

### Ask yourself: Have Times Ever Truly Been Easy?
Speaking for myself, I am unable to recall any time in my life that was genuinely easy. Of course, looking back, I can identify periods that were _easier_ than others, but were any of those times truly _easy_?

I think there are moments in our lives that offer greater rewards for our efforts, and some that do not. It is the _reward_ that is remembered, not the pain you pushed through to accomplish it.

So, when we condition ourselves for difficult times, I believe we are preparing for the _lack of rewards_ for enduring a new (or revisited) hardship. Yes, the world is in turmoil, but let me ask you, has the world ever been truly at peace? There have always been roadblocks, and there always will be. Challenges do not get easier to overcome; you just become stronger.

### Time For Reflection
I implore you to reflect on your hardships and what you have overcome. Take a moment to be proud of what you have endured and conquered, despite the odds. You are here. You are a fighter, whether you see yourself as one or not.

Living in this world, for most, is not easy. But it is worth it. Our world can be as beautiful or as ugly as we make it. Nearly every hardship that we have faced, and will face, is due to our own actions. The best way to minimize hardships is to be mindful of our actions and the possible outcomes that each decision may have, and this is one simple way we can minimize the hardships we encounter in life.


### You Make a Difference
During these times of uncertainty, all we can do is the best we can. Be mindful that others are struggling with their own unique challenges, and if we were as quick to help as we are to judge, the world would be a better place.
