### **Geek Bar vs. Geek Boost: More Than Just a Knockoff?**

I vape. It’s one of my last remaining vices. Let's be clear, it's not _healthy_, but I figure it’s a step up from smoking or, you know, inhaling tremendous amounts of narcotics. I’m writing this because I had a realization about what might be happening behind the scenes in the vape world, and I wanted to share the differences between two brands you might encounter: **Geek Bar** and **Geek Boost**.

I detest anything wasteful, and let's be honest, disposable vapes are the definition of that. But for those of us who choose to vape (while we still have the _choice_ here in America), allow me to share some thoughts.

My go-to has always been the **Geek Bar**. It’s made with high-quality components, is incredibly easy to use, and is consistently satisfying, no matter the flavor. That is, until about six months ago. I opened two duds in a row. Both were identical, and both tasted like I was inhaling a rancid, death-like flavor (I sincerely hope this doesn't become a trend).

After some digging, I learned that Geek Bar had a counterfeiting problem. Low-quality knock-offs were flooding the market. Whether my local gas station was aware of what they were selling is neither here nor there. However, The fakes were remarkable; nearly indistinguishable without close scrutiny. But the tech always failed. The vape would keep burning after I stopped inhaling, it wouldn't charge or shut off properly, and the taste… well, I hope to never experience it again.

Last week, at a new, reputable vape shop I found, I spotted a new product: the **Geek Boost**. It was a direct replica of the Geek Bar. I don't know how such a blatant rip-off gets mass-produced without a lawsuit, but that's not my department. The price, however, was impossible to ignore: **$23.95** compared to the Geek Bar's **$36.95**. Being low on funds, as is often the case, I decided to give the knockoff brand a try.

#### **First Thoughts on the Geek Boost**

My first theory was that the original counterfeiters had gone legit and created their own low-budget brand. The quality was certainly a step up from the terrible fakes I'd encountered before.

The tech inside was _nearly_ as good as the original. The inhalation mechanism felt slightly off, forcing me to take longer draws to get a satisfying hit. The Geek Boost also charged about half as fast as the brand-name version.

But all in all, for the price, it was a decent vape. I still worry about low-budget vape juices, as there are no definitive long-term studies. In terms of battery life, both devices seem to drain at about the same speed for me—I use roughly 10% of the capacity per day.

#### **Wrapping Up**

Overall, I’m cautiously pleased with the Geek Boost. Whether it was originally a company that produced counterfeits will remain a mystery. However, the quality, especially when contrasted with the significant cost savings, is substantial enough for me to justify the switch for now.
