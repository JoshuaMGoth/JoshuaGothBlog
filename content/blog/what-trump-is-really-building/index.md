# Built in Plain Sight: The Red Flags and Secret Purpose of Trump's Project

"I think we can all agree that Trump isn’t building a ballroom. There's more than enough financial and logistical evidence against it, which means the entire story is a cover. But a cover for _what_? If they could keep a project of this magnitude, with these players, completely hushed up, you can bet they would deny everything.

Let’s break down what we know logically. We know the funding was private, with amounts undisclosed per donor.

To me, that’s a monster red flag and another blatant disregard for laws and policy. Work on government infrastructure should come from a government budget. The line separating the private and public sector has all but washed away under the Trump administration, as he continues to stomp all over democracy and wipe his ass with it.

How does he get away with any of this? I’ll save that question for another series of posts.

I digress. Let’s get back to the investors involved—all the heavy hitters. Now, if I were spearheading the largest hush-hush project under the guise of a ballroom, what’s the best way to keep it a secret? Build it in plain sight and deny everything, planting seeds of misdirection until the media shifts our attention to something else. Make us forget what’s happening right in front of our eyes.

I understand that governments need a degree of secrecy to protect national security, etc., etc. But I want us to go back to that investor list for a moment and take a long, hard look.

Let's just look at the names:

- **Altria Group** (parent company of Philip Morris USA)
    
- **Amazon**
    
- **Apple**
    
- **Booz Allen Hamilton** (major defense and intelligence contractor)
    
- **Caterpillar**
    
- **Coinbase** (cryptocurrency exchange)
    
- **Comcast Corporation** (parent of NBCUniversal)
    
- **Hard Rock International**
    
- **Google**
    
- **HP Inc.**
    
- **Lockheed Martin**
    
- **Meta Platforms** (Facebook)
    
- **Micron Technology**
    
- **Microsoft**
    
- **NextEra Energy**
    
- **Palantir Technologies** (data analytics for intelligence)
    
- **Reynolds American** (tobacco company)
    
- **Ripple** (blockchain payments company)
    
- **T-Mobile**
    
- **Tether America** (cryptocurrency company)
    
- **Union Pacific Railroad**
    
### Let's be Real
To me, that list doesn’t scream ‘ballroom.’ It screams a massive, multi-faceted tech and infrastructure project of some kind.

Just spitballing here: I’ve been part of a few data center rollouts for some of the largest tech giants in the country. I used to work daily in a Tier-5 data center in Colorado, and the square footage is in the same ballpark as what’s being constructed. As a project lead, if I were tasked with building a data center to house the collected knowledge, data, and history of all humankind—basically, a full replication of the front and back end of the internet—the most powerful entities in the United States would all have to be involved. You would need the cloud giants (**Amazon, Google, Microsoft**), the hardware makers (**HP, Apple, Micron**), the network enablers (**T-Mobile, Comcast**), the AI and data wranglers (**Palantir, Meta, Booz Allen**), the energy provider (**NextEra**), the heavy machinery (**Caterpillar**), the logistics (**Union Pacific**), and even the future of finance (**Coinbase, Ripple, Tether**). The names on that donor list are a perfect match.

On top of that, this data would need to be stored in the single most protected space in the United States, under direct control in case we lost all cloud connections. You would have to build something in your backyard that you could terminal into directly. What good would a data center in NORAD be if you couldn't access it?

No cloud system. Nothing remote. All the data. All secured. All on-site in your backyard.

### Safeguarding Our Way of Life
There’s nothing wrong with redundancy and securing our history and way of life. So why hide it, even if it _is_ a data center or a project to safeguard our future? Our collective history is currently spread across countless servers throughout the world.

Again, why the secrecy? It’s simple. If an extinction-level event were to occur, there would be no way to access or recall any of that data. It would be lost—an electronic Library of Alexandria, once again lost to the ages.

However, if you build it so that all the world's data is in a single location, air-gapped from external threats, you now have a contingency plan to rebuild our way of life. And you build it under the location where the core of a working government would continue to run.

Which means they would know something we don't. And to keep order—and thus, a functioning civilization—the truth would need to be kept behind closed doors. We don’t prepare for what-ifs on this level; that much I feel we can agree on. Our government was caught with its pants down during COVID. Despite having information and time to act, we did nothing. Our government has proven we can’t prepare for anything.

But perhaps with a little sway from the private sector, along with their funding and combined brainpower, they could build something in time.

Something is coming. Or maybe it’s not. Or maybe this is really for the construction of a ballroom… on the top floor. But who knows how many floors lie beneath?

### Then Again, it Could Simply be a Ballroom.
In the end, is it the answers we really seek, or is it simply pleasing to the mind to wonder? This is why I love to take *Thought Trots*, To be endlessly curious and to explore. But above all, to never stop asking questions; Never stop seeking answers."
