# Living *with* Depression (Part 2)

In the first part of this series, I discussed methods that have helped me in my personal journey to manage depression. In this part, I will focus on ways that loved ones and caregivers can support those who suffer from depression.

I could compile a lengthy list of things not to do when someone you love is experiencing a depressive episode based on my own experiences with less-than-understanding partners. However, I believe it's more beneficial to focus on the positives. Here are some methods that have proven helpful for those supporting someone with depression:

#### Patience

Living with someone who experiences depression can be trying at best. It is essential to remain patient, especially when you lack a comprehensive understanding of what your loved one is going through. It's challenging to be patient when you often find yourself in the role of caregiver rather than partner. However, keeping calm and composed will help create a more peaceful environment for both parties.

#### Education

Take time to learn about depression, its causes, and effects on the mind, body, and self (the person you love). Knowledge is power, and understanding depression will better equip you to provide appropriate care and support.

#### Support

Show compassion and kindness towards your loved one during their challenging times. Speak calmly and without judgment as you offer encouragement. Let them know that they are valued, beautiful, and important individuals. Building self-confidence through acknowledging their achievements is an essential aspect of the healing process.

#### Guidance

Actively participate in your loved one's care by scheduling appointments and attending meetings with healthcare professionals. By observing episodes from a supportive perspective, you can ensure they receive optimal care, increasing their chances for success.

#### Listen

Be a compassionate listener who truly listens without judgment. Create a safe space where your loved one feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings openly. Sometimes, simply listening is all that's needed at the moment to help them feel heard and understood.

#### Self-Care

To provide effective support, it's essential that you prioritize your wellbeing. You cannot assist others if you are depleted yourself. Ensure that you engage in self-care activities to refill your emotional energy tank and maintain a positive outlook on life. When your loved one sees you actively practicing self-care, they will be more likely to join you.

#### Don't Lose Hope

Living with depression is difficult, both for the person experiencing it and their loved ones. Making mistakes along the way is inevitable. Stay patient, kind, and hopeful. Remember that you are making a difference and potentially saving a life by offering your unwavering support.
