#The Path to Mindfulness and the Power of Change
Mindfulness is an extraordinary ability, bordering on the supernatural. Practicing mindfulness is akin to an intense mental workout at the gym, but instead of building physical strength, it enhances your mental capacities. Imagine having the power to regulate your heart rate, blood pressure, moods, perspectives, and interactions with people just by focusing your thoughts. This guide does not focus on wishing things into existence (although I encourage spreading positive energies for everyone), but rather provides a crash course in exercises designed to help you cultivate a stronger mind.

Does this sound too good to be true? I assure you, it is not. But what exactly is mindfulness? How can we apply being mindful in our hectic, modern world?

To start, let’s look at where this all began. The concept of mindfulness, rooted deeply in Buddhist philosophy, originates from the Pali term 'sati,' which translates to awareness, attention, or consciousness. This foundational aspect of mindfulness emphasizes living in the present moment, a principle championed by Siddhārtha Gautama, known as the Buddha. His teachings, dating back to the 5th century BCE, revolve around the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, both of which advocate for the cultivation of awareness and understanding of one's thoughts and actions.

### Understanding Objectivity

Objectivity in thought refers to the ability to evaluate situations, emotions, and beliefs without being influenced by personal biases. This concept goes hand-in-hand with mindfulness, as it allows individuals to observe their thoughts and feelings in a neutral manner, rather than reacting impulsively based on preconceived notions or emotional responses. Recognizing cognitive biases—systematic errors in thinking that affect perceptions and decision-making—is a vital aspect of fostering objectivity. Common cognitive biases include confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and availability heuristic. I implore you to go down the rabbit hole and read more about the science behind cognitive biases. I also suggest reading (Insert book title here).

To cultivate an objective mindset, one effective approach is to engage in reflective practices. This involves pausing to consider the reasons behind one's thoughts before accepting them as truth. Journaling can serve as a useful tool in this process. By writing down thoughts and feelings, individuals can identify patterns and challenge biased beliefs. Another practical strategy is seeking feedback from others. Collaborating with trusted peers can provide external viewpoints that illuminate potential biases one may not recognize alone.

Emotional regulation plays a vital role in achieving objectivity. By managing intense emotions, individuals can prevent them from clouding their judgment and affecting their core beliefs. Techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and grounding exercises are useful practices to help regulate emotions. Furthermore, mindfulness itself is a powerful ally in reaching clarity of thought. By maintaining present-moment awareness and non-judgmental observation, individuals can learn to separate their thoughts from their self-identity, thus enabling them to approach situations with a clearer, more objective mindset.

I would like to be clear that the art of mindfulness has grown and been adapted by many as a peaceful, successful and powerful way to transform your thinking and strengthen your mind, but does not require one to be a Buddhist, or even spiritual for that matter. Adapt mindfulness to how it fits in your life; to how it works for you.

## Practical Steps to Practicing Mindfulness

Although I have practiced mindfulness for as long as I can remember (before knowing what the concept of mindfulness was), it wasn’t until a life-altering event in April 2021 that put me on the path to self-discovery. Out of the many books on the topic, the methods listed below are what I discovered to be most successful on my path to understanding meditation, mindfulness, and the beauty of self. These methods may or may not work for you, but I encourage you to try, as well as to seek out methods that you may find better suited to your own life and personal journey.

### Understanding Self

Who are you? Really? Do you see yourself as others do? Do you want to know why you do things that you like or dislike? I found that the practice of mindfulness works great on paper, but difficult in practice. I feel the best way to start any journey is to start with one’s self.

The first step is not the quick and easy path to mindfulness, and objective thought really doesn’t require it. However, I discovered that knowing *why* you do, feel, and react the way you do in certain situations, helps make you aware of everything, and helps you to cognitively be aware of all that you do and say in order to truly control everything about you. This may require hours, days, or even weeks to complete. But I promise you, truly discovering and knowing yourself elevates not only the understanding of self, but the understanding of our human condition. It allows you to connect in ways never dreamed or thought possible.

On a piece of paper, create two columns. On one column, write down everything about yourself that you like; the other, write everything you don’t like. Be completely honest. Only you are going to see this, and only you know things that others will never know.

On each item, think deeply about that trait. Meditate for as long as you need to on each one. Discover the root of that feeling / trait. Understand it. Learn what triggers that feeling, and what the source of that trigger was.

Please, take your time with this. Clear your mind and focus on the one aspect of self that you wrote down.

### Breathing

One of the fundamental techniques is breath awareness. This practice involves focusing your attention on your breathing. To begin, find a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take deep, slow breaths. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. This practice helps anchor your thoughts in the present moment, reducing feelings of anxiety and distraction, keeping your mind from wandering.

Don’t get discouraged. For those new to meditation, the average time that you are able to concentrate without invading thoughts is only about 10–15 seconds. The brain is like any muscle, and it takes work to grow stronger.

### Inventory of Self

Another effective method is the body scan technique. This involves mentally scanning your body from head to toe, paying close attention to any areas of tension or discomfort. Begin by focusing on your feet, gradually moving upwards. Acknowledge any sensations without judgment, allowing yourself to relax into each area. The body scan can foster a deeper connection with physical sensations and promote relaxation. This technique helps ground yourself, which helps easy anxieties.

### Listen to yourself

Listen to yourself as others are listening. Pickup nuances that you did not know that you had.  
Mindful observation of thoughts and emotions is essential. Instead of suppressing or resisting difficult feelings, observe them as they arise. Acknowledge these thoughts without attaching any labels, allowing them to pass like clouds in the sky. This approach encourages emotional resilience and self-awareness.

### Constructive criticism

No one likes to be told that they do things that may trouble other people. Nuances that you may have not been aware of; oftentimes embarrassing. We cannot correct what we do not know. The journey to mindfulness, self realization is just that; a journey. You must be open to constructive criticisms, as it aids you further into discovering who you are. Look forward to these enlightening moments as you take time to meditate and understand them. Self betterment is addicting, and quickly turns into a hobby.

## The Immediate payout

In a society that doesn't have time to be patient, we tend to want everything *now*, even results for the slightest bit of effort. I can assure you, that when you put these methods into practice, you will begin to see the benefits immediately. In time, you will notice that others may start to compliment you, take notice, or rejoice in this 'new you'.

#### Control

One of the immediate benefits is increased emotional regulation. By staying present and observing thoughts without judgment, one can develop a greater awareness of their emotional responses. This heightened awareness enables us to manage our reactions more effectively, leading to improved interactions in both personal and professional life.

#### Concentration

Research has shown that mindfulness can enhance focus and concentration. A study published in the journal *Cognitive, Effective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience* found that individuals who practice mindfulness exhibit thicker gray matter in regions of the brain associated with attention and cognitive processing. This finding suggests that engaging in mindfulness exercises not only helps individuals stay present, but also boosts their overall cognitive capabilities, making them more productive in their daily tasks.

#### Focus

Moreover, mindfulness has been linked to reduced stress levels. Even those new to practicing mindfulness have reported a feeling of a greater sense of calm and clarity, even in challenging situations. For instance, countless people who integrate mindfulness into their lives share transformative stories about overcoming anxiety and stress-related disorders.

#### Relationships

Improved relationships also emerge as a notable benefit of mindfulness. By fostering a non-judgmental attitude and enhancing empathy, we often find that our communication improves significantly. We become more attentive listeners, leading to deeper connections with friends, family, and colleagues. As our commitment to mindfulness grows, we discover that our relationships flourish as mutual understanding and respect grow for one another.
