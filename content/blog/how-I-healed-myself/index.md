# My Body's Secret: The Unlikely Technique That Healed What Doctors Couldn't.

Late last year I was diagnosed with Upper and Lower Spinal Stenosis. For those of you unfamiliar with this condition, it essentially means that the sockets in between the bones in my spine have worn down and the vertebrae are grinding against one another. 

Like normal wear and tear on an aged automobile, this is a condition that many people suffer from. The only issue that I had with this, was that it is usually diagnosed in the elderly, ages 80+. Put simply, I have put far too many miles on this engine. 

Every day became more painful than the last. I could not sit at a computer for more than five minutes without losing feeling in my arms, followed by my fingers growing numb. Driving became impossible. Eventually, walking to the kitchen and back became an unbearable chore. 

I tried everything I could. I sought help from pain management clinics, my primary care physician, spinal specialist. No relief. This left me with the only option - Surgery. 

### Why Surgery Worried Me.

My father-in-law had spinal decompression surgery at 82. It did not help him much, if at all. I also wasn't too keen on putting my ability to walk and the use of my limbs into the hands of a stranger that could be going through the worst times of their life. Now, I can accept age, and what happens to the body over time. However, this condition came at me 40 years too soon. No one should live in this amount of pain. To make matters worse, I had my gall bladder removed at the age of 21 due to a drug overdoes that left me hospitalized and near dead for a week, so my body cannot break down medication like those with a gall bladder. 

Long Story Short
I did not have surgery. I now live without any pain whatsoever, and all due to a technique that I discovered that changed my life. 

This method was really a two-fold win for me. One, it allowed me to free up negative energy that I have held onto for over 30 years, and Two, it enabled me to reprogram my cells in order for my body to heal itself. 

This breathing method is taken directly from [Dr. Joe Dispenza's book *Becoming Supernatural*](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supernatural-Common-People-Uncommon-ebook/dp/B0746RN3G7). The book goes into the scientific and medical details of this method, which involves the movement of Cerebrospinal fluid from the base of your spine and up throughout the brain. I encourage you to buy the book, as it has taught me how to heal myself in ways that do not seem possible. 

**Take a restful, meditative stance**

> Contract the intrinsic muscles of your perineum ( your pelvic floor, the same muscles you use for intercourse and elimination) and you locked them down, and then while they were locked down, you next contracted the muscles of your lower abdomen, locking those muscles down, and then you did the same with the muscles of your upper abdomen.  If you kept squeezing and contracting those muscles, in your first three energy centers by contracting your core muscles, that fluid in your central nervous system would move up. You'd be moving that cerebrospinal fluid in your central nervous system up your spine. Each time you tighten the muscles of those centers, the fluid would be forced upward. 
> 
> Now Image you then placed your attention on the top of your head. Where you place your attention is where you place your energy, so if you put your attention at the top of your head, that would become your target for moving energy. Now think about taking one, slow steady breath through your nose and at the same time, squeezing and holding the muscles of your perineum, then those of your lower abdomen, and then those of your upper abdomen- all while following your breath up your spine and through your chest, your throat, and your brain, and all the way to the top of your head. Imagine that when you get to the top of your head, you hold your breath as you keep squeezing.

Basically, in this exercise, you are taking a deep breath, and forcing it through your body, starting with your perineum and exhaling out of your Crown Chakra, and to your Ka. Perform this twice in a row. 


### The Human body is Energy. We can Learn How to Manipulate The Energy Going Through and Around Us in Order to Benefit Ourselves.

Our mind is an incredible machine, and mastering exercises, such as the one above, continues to show us how little we know about the human mind, and that of our human condition. 
How a simple breathing exercise combined with mindful thought reprogrammed my cells in order to heal myself. 

*Sound impossible? As is many things we take for granted in everyday life. It’s amazing how quickly impossible turns into improbable, then unlikely, and finally possible once we put our minds to it. *
