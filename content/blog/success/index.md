#Learning to See What Truly Matters in Life
As I've emphasized before, nearly everything in life is subjective, and our concept of success is no exception. So, what does success mean? If you asked 100 different people about their idea of success, you'd likely get 100 distinct answers. For many, success is merely a reflection of one's personal dreams or ultimate goals in life.

Success can also be viewed through multiple lenses. What I mean by that is, success can be seen as an overall achievement, as well as individual accomplishments. A person may excel in companionship but struggle in other areas, yet still be considered successful as a parent.

So, how do we measure success? As I've said, the concept of success is subjective, but it can be defined according to the journey involved. If I had to define success personally, I'd say *Success is doing what everyone told you couldn't be done*.

**Understanding Success: A Contrasting Perspective**

The reason we often misunderstand our concept of success is that it's inherently subjective. If you look at a CEO who appears successful, it may not necessarily be the case. For instance, if someone was born into wealth and privilege, can their position truly be considered a reflection of genuine success, or is it merely a product of circumstance?

Consider this: A person who grew up in an abusive household, became homeless, and overcame addiction to achieve a fulfilling life – are they more successful than the CEO born with every advantage? Or is success solely about external validation, rather than personal growth?

**The Root Problem with Success**

Success is oftentimes tied to happiness, which will inevitably lead to a life of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Happiness is not a destination. You cannot book a flight to happiness, make dinner reservations at happiness, or settle down with a family in happiness. Happiness, in my opinion, is oftentimes misidentified as contentment, which is to be truly at peace with your life how it is now. *That* should be the ultimate goal for all of us. Happiness is an elevated state, oftentimes fleeting. Contentment, however, is a state of longevity, a long term *peace* with oneself, if you will.

My point is, don't compare yourself to others; instead, focus on personal growth and becoming the best version of yourself. Success starts within you, and it's not tied to external measures like career advancement or material wealth. The path to success lies in embracing your journey and striving to become the person you aspire to be.
