# Welcome to My Cine-Sadism: An Unnecessarily Thorough, and Objective Critique on Fims


I am, by the sacred and often-misguided traditions of cinema, what you might call a “tough critic.” But let’s be specific, because I don’t just hate things for funsies (okay, maybe a little for funsies). My particular brand of pedantry is laser-focused on one thing: **the writing.** The prose. The script. The sacred text that some director probably used to line a birdcage before filming began.

Allow me to make one thing clear: I don’t care if I personally _vibe_ with a movie, or not. A film can be about the passionate love affair between a sentient paperclip and a desiccated orange, and if the story is airtight, the characters are compelling, and the emotional payoff lands, I will sing its praises from the rooftops. Conversely, a movie can star all my favorite actors, have a budget larger than the GDP of a small nation, and feature a soundtrack exclusively composed of puppies barking the Beatles, and if the script is a dumpster fire, I will be there with a gasoline can and a mischievous smile.

Point in fact: I don’t think a single one of my comfort movies—you know, the cinematic security blankets you put on in the background while folding laundry or contemplating your life choices—would even scrape a **B-** grade on the Official Scale of Cinematic Profundity™. We’re talking about films where the plot is held together with chewing gum and hope, and the character development is a straight line to Explosionsville. I love them. I adore them. They are the cinematic equivalent of a greasy cheeseburger at 2 AM. But I am not here to review my guilty pleasures. I am here to perform an autopsy.

This, my friends, is the grand announcement of my new series: **‘Movie Reviews’**.  But this isn’t just any review series. Think of it less as a critique and more as a support group for abused narratives. We’re going to look at the movies that **stand out.**. The movies that left an impact so profound (whether positive, or negative), that not only have I been unable to free my mind from them, I transformed a blog into a therapy session under the clever guise of a movie review. Either way, I hope you enjoy my take on the titans, the train wrecks, and the tragic almost-weres.


#### My (Arrogant) Pseudo Credentials for Judgement.

You might be wondering, “Who died and made you the king of cinema?” The answer is: no one. I seized this power through sheer, unadulterated gumption.

My day job—or more accurately, my soul’s vocation—is that of a **creative writer.** But I prefer the term _**Story Teller**_. A “writer” can be someone who crafts compelling emails about quarterly reports. A _Story Teller_ is someone who understands the architecture of narrative, the ebb and flow of tension, and the sacred contract between the tale and the listener. It’s the difference between a house painter and Michelangelo. (Yes, I just compared myself to Michelangelo. The arrogance is part of the brand, please keep up.)


#### **Let’s Get Ready to Rumble (Politely, in the Comments)**

Now, a crucial disclaimer, delivered with all the sincerity of a used car salesman: **This is all just my objective take.**

You may read my scorching hot take on a beloved classic and think, “This person is a philistine with the artistic sensibility of a baked potato.” Conversely, you may read my gushing praise for a forgotten indie gem and think, “Finally, someone who gets it!"

**And that is completely, 100%, absolutely fine.** In fact, it’s encouraged. The comments section is not a battlefield; it’s a post-movie debrief at a bar where the drinks are strong and the opinions are stronger. I desperately want to hear from you. Did I miss the point entirely? Do you have a brilliant counter-argument? Did my proposed fix for the movie’s climax create an even bigger plot hole? **Tell me!** Let’s argue, let’s laugh, let’s collectively mourn what could have been.

So, strap in. Subscribe to this blog if you want your inbox to be occasionally blessed with cinematic fury and adulation. We’re about to embark on a journey through the best and worst that Hollywood (and beyond) has to offer. We’ll laugh, we’ll cry, and we’ll all collectively wonder why that character didn’t just use the perfectly functional phone in their pocket to solve the entire conflict in the first act.

Im working on my first line-up, tacking my favorites of misunderstood masterpieces or a narrative crime scenes—I haven't decided yet. You’ll have to wait and see.

*May the odds be ever in your favor, and may the scripts be ever in our… well, you get it.*
