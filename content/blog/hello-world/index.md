### 10 Years Lost and 20 Years Taken.

I feel it’s best to kick off this new site with a story. I promise, it won’t take long.

A ghost. A recluse. Once the center of events, I had withdrawn from everything that I knew and loved. It was not by choice. Not at first.

Ten years ago, I was poisoned with pride. Magnetic. Charismatic. Having come from the streets, I pulled myself out of places where hope held no domain to having everything that I had wanted. I was at the peak of my career as a Network Engineer. Flashy new German cars. All the toys I could possibly flaunt, and everything I needed to stay on top of all of my hobbies. I was the center of envy, and that nourished me around every turn.

Then, in one night, it was gone. Everything. My house. My career. My cars. My toys. My wife, and most importantly, my daughter. But the loss that carried most of the weight was that of my pride. I was given a strike, and a felony. Not only did I lose everything, I was given a mark that would keep me from getting it back.

It was back to the streets. Back to where my life started. Homelessness. Hardships. Hell. I spent twenty years clawing my way out of what I was born into, only to find myself back at the beginning. Twenty years of my life that I will never get back. All for nothing.

Or so I thought.

I built this blog to share all that I learned, and the experiences that taught them to me.

### My Unsweetened Delivery: I Do Not Sugarcoat Reality. 

I am a real person, and as such, will convey real truths. I will talk about real topics. Not as they should be, or as we see them, but as they are. Real life, experiences, perspectives, advice and stories, typed by a real human (me) instead of AI-page-filling-fodder. This blog isn’t like most others. It does not focus on a single topic. You will not find an ad-riddled site filled with sales pitches. You will not find regurgitated, page-filling, AI fodder. Just real topics brought to you by an open, objective viewpoint, and all written by ‘yours truly’. You will find that, like me (and many of us), the topics that I blog about fill a broad spectrum, including lessons, stories, hobbies, life-hacks, career advice, and everything in between.

I hope you enjoy reading the site as much as I enjoyed creating it. It isn’t perfect, and will always be in a state of flux—again—like many of us. However, if you run into any glaring technical issues, or perhaps have some advice (or just want to reach out and share similar stories), please contact me.

Thank you,

Joshua M. Goth.

Let’s begin, shall we?
