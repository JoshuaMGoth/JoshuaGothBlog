# **My Love Affair with Nintendo is Becoming a New Project**

It’s no secret that I have been a huge fan of Nintendo since I was about nine or ten years old. It all started on a Christmas morning back in 1988. I had just come home from the ER the day before after my first serious brush with death, and that morning, I unwrapped my first Nintendo Entertainment System. Call it what you will; Addiction or brain Damage, but from that moment on, there was simply no turning back. That gray box wasn't just a toy; it was a portal to something that, like many others, helped shaped some of my childhood and the rest of my life. 

I’m also no secret that I like to keep myself busy. One form of medicine that I use to keep the anxiety at bay is to create things. I love projects. I live for them. So, it only makes sense to combine all of these passions right here.

Without listing everything (and therefore spoiling the surprise), let's just say that between my short-story writing, novel drafting, web-application testing, and blogging—not to mention my most important roles as an active father and husband—I have a lot of creative cogs grinding in the machine upstairs, so to speak. But one side-project, in particular, has become one of my largest and most exciting time sinks, and I can’t wait to share it with you as soon as it's ready.[^1]

### New Menu Coming

To give these ideas a proper home, I’ll be creating a new projects menu on the site, and updating them as I go. I want to see how these web apps perform and if they can generate enough traffic and interest to stand on their own. If they do, the plan is to move them to their own dedicated domain, where I can rely on ads and marketing to make them self-sustaining. For now, they’ll live as subdomains right here.

If this first project generates enough traffic to justify placing a few ads on the site, I will be thrilled to continue extending and supporting it for as long as possible. Your engagement is what will fuel its growth.

So, what is this big project? Let’s get to the tease.

Since I am very "old-school" when it comes to my entertainment, I’m starting this project with five distinct categories. For each of the following Nintendo systems, I will be presenting a definitive list of the **Top 25 titles** in its category:

- **Nintendo (NES)**
    
- **Super Nintendo (SNES)**
    
- **Game Boy Advance (GBA)**
    
- **Nintendo 2DS**
    
- **Nintendo 3DS**
    

That’s all I’m going to say for now. No hints on the category! 

Yes, I know this site isn’t specifically a gaming site. It isn’t really an _anything_ site. It’s more of an _everything_ site. And honestly, that’s what excites me. Without a rigid destination, I look forward to seeing how everything grows organically and discovering what it becomes.

I hope you will join me on this journey. None of this matters without you. Your visits, your comments, and your shared excitement are what make these projects worthwhile.

[^1]: Its difficult to gauge the size of a project. I work on where the creativity tends to flow. My largest projects may not be my largest *Time Consuming* projects, but the projects that took the most effort to learn, compile, and share. My smallest projects me be the largest in size, and the largest, well. . . the smallest.
