# Humanity: A Double-Edged Sword

Humanity is a double-edged sword. Our ingenuity goes hand-in-hand with our stupidity; of that, I am sure we can all agree. But why? Why do we choose _not_ to fix what is? Why do those in power consistently fail to make the choices that would better society, and instead only better themselves?

Plainly put, we have the resources to solve nearly every problem on earth, yet we **choose** not to. Perhaps it's merely my own personal lack of understanding, but if I were in a position of insurmountable wealth, I wouldn't do everything I could to keep society down. I would focus on ensuring the survival of our species.

If you had more money than your great-grandchildren would know what to do with, I feel it's not only about the changes you can make while you are still here, but the changes your actions continue to make after you're gone.
### Building a Legacy
That is what we should strive for: a legacy. There is an old quote: "If you want to live forever, do something worth remembering." These people in power could still have that power by doing what is right. Their names could be synonymous with saving our planet, with building and creating jobs, technology, and laws that aid all of us, instead of just their own personal agendas.

Instead, those with power hoard it for their own ends, when they could be going down in history while building a positive name for themselves.

We have no right to act surprised in the event of our own downfall, as we have had every opportunity to change this planet for the better. We could be working together instead of against one another—building more efficient engines for star ships instead of more efficient ways to kill our neighbors.

### My Hope
I hope one day the owners of this planet come together and work to change how the world is. To work together, building space machines instead of war machines. To end petty bickering and understand that we do not have a lot of time left. If those in power led by example, pooled resources to repair our planet, and gave us the ability to travel the stars, we may just have hope.

But until we are able to see past our own selfish desires, I feel it's not a matter of _if_ our story fades out, but _when_.
### Then Again,. . .

*Perhaps, in order to change the course of humankind—to change what drives us—we need to change what it means to be _human_.*
